Cold and dry, but everything is my favorite color.
The moons may be a problem for wearwolf.
But the mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity.
Vampires may enjoy the cold weather.
Maybe they should consider going to different planets
The mosquitos will certainly bother everyone
We must pack repellent
